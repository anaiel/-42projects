42 is an innovative school in Paris, France where students age 18 and over, regardless of prior education, teach themselves and each other about code. There are no classes, no teachers: the cursus consists of a series of projects students have to complete to gain experience and get to the next levels. Collaboration is key: the students corect each other's projets and learn to cooperate and share their findings and struggles.

I started my cursus in November 2019, and this has been my main occupation since.

## Cursus overview

Because of its innovative system, there is no strict progression along the cursus and no school year. Students can come to school anytime they want, and validate their projects at their own pace. For every project they validate, they gain experience, which allows them to gain levels, which in turn allows them to finish the cursus once they get to level 21.

The cursus has an estimated duration of 3 years.

### üèä Piscine

The **Piscine** is the selection program to get access to the school. For a month, candidates must complete as many projects, or *days* as possible. The projects are aimed at developping the students coding skills, from scratch. They all use the C language. There are also exams every Friday evenings, as well as *rushes* (2-day group projects) and personnal projects during the weekends.

‚úèÔ∏è I attended the August 2018 Piscine, with very little prior knowledge about coding (I used to be an English teacher), and managed to get in!

### üí´ Holy Graph

Once accepted, students can start their cursus and have more autonomy to choose the projects they want to apply themselves to. The projects are represented on this map, which is called the Holy Graph.

<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/oxohdQY.jpg"></p>

Students start in the inner circle, on the left. Once they get to the center of the circle, they can choose to continue on the right branch (algorithms), the top branch (unix), or the bottom branch (graphics), which are all C projects. In order to access projects beyond the inner circle, they must get to level 5, complete one of the branches and do a 4- to 6-month internship. The cursus comes to an end with a final intership.

‚úèÔ∏è So far I am still within the inner circle and have completed a couple of graphics projects and the PHP piscine, but my main focus has been on the algorithm branch, which I finally completed in July 2019!

### üéí Other projects

The inner circles also gives access to other projects which tackle other languages : the **systems administration** projets, the **Piscine PHP** (which gives access to the web branch), or the **electronics** program.

‚úèÔ∏è On top of that, I also took part in **Machine Learning** workshops supervised by 42AI, the Artificial Intelligence club at 42.

## üíª Projects

Grades are given to every project. 100 is the top score for the mandatory part of the project. Points between 100 and 125 are given for bonuses.

### üîµ Inner circle

All project in the inner circle, except the web and SysAdmin branches, are done using the C language and following a strict standard, the **Norm**, which you can find in the *resources* folder. For example, functions cannot have more than 25 lines, there cannot be more than 5 function in a .c file, the Makefile may not relink, etc.

#### üí° Machile learning workshops

<a href="https://github.com/42-AI"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NJdFptU.jpg" align="left" width="110" /></a>

Every week I attend the machine learning workshops with [42AI](https://github.com/42-AI), the association for Artificial Intelligence at 42. The workshops aim at giving an understanding of the main machine learning algorithms. Every week, a student gives a presentation on an algorithm, followed by a practical application for the attendees to get their hands dirty, using python and numpy.
I gave the presentation about the k-means clustering algorithm.
More information about the content of the workshops and my exercises [here](https://github.com/anaiel/workshops_machinelearning).
